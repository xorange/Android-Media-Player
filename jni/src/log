sth weird happen. run failed on voidmain.c.

not the values/strings/app_name problem.

/SDL works. I use SDL/SDLActivity, failed. use /SDL built libs, failed.
So I'm pretty sure it's not the code problem.




I used the SDL folder and removed the previous MediaPlayer project entirely and I've got the brand new MediaPlayer project with the content same as the SDL project and then I run function tests step by step to use it.

Now it seems that the previous problem may be related to my didn't run make clean.

The basic function tests:
1. voidmain.c //void
//ok
2. sdltest.c //red window
//ok
3. codeffmpeg.c //void, compiled with ffmpeg //problem running, even with being reduced to a void main.
add: System.loadLibrary("ffmpeg"); in java. solved.
//ok

what i've done today:
1. 
try logcat in native code. didn't work. //ok

#include <android/log.h>
#define INFO(msg) __android_log_write(ANDROID_LOG_INFO,"video.c",msg);

1941 KB/s (38342915 bytes in 19.289s)


logcat with only one "video.c" tag:
I/video.c (  740): render present done
and window turns white, meaning previous logcats weren't sent. That is, argc >= 2, supported codec, SDL_Init success.
Time at 8:30. make a cup of tea:)

gotta work!
time at 9. reviewed on the C array addressing, pretty sure about the way of using "pixels" and "pitch" in video.c is wrong now.

blank half hour with nothing done. :(

have to solve the problem: push a.mp4 before the app launches 'cause I've remembered there's something wrong about re-launching an SDL app.
But currently re-launching the app is ok and keep getting "white window" followed by:
org.libsdl.app libc Fatal signal 11 ...

no SDL_QueryTexturePixels but with SDL_QueryTexture. what the hell.

things didn't work in the video stream iterating.
Things to do afternoon:
1. find a way to debug. see the variables' value. DDMS.
//gdbserver. so complex- -
2. get it done.

#
weird. add this:
INFO(argv[1]);
but failed. "white window" still ok.

with:
char *str[2]; str[0] = "abc"; str[1] = "/sdcard/a.mp4"; 
this way is ok:
printf("%s\n%s\n", str[0], str[1]);
this is ok, too:
printf(str[1]);

so i'm guessing argv[1] have the "/sdcard/a.mp4";
indeed. 
add:
INFO(argv[0]);
INFO(argv[1]);
in SDL_android_main.cpp, got the expected output.

well, adding
INFO("why");
figures it out. A constant string works kinda like a flush?

#
OMG

#
does ffmpeg really works?
as for a specific video file, compare the data of AVPicture structure
then try output a snapshot, a frame of it
then try the whole stream
BUT first, see if the pre-functions work. why the functions still work even without a real video file?????

//using another project and I get to know that the file path is /mnt/sdcard/a.mp4, using this, when I use this: INFO(pFormatCtx->filename);, I get the expected filepath. Does this indicates that ffmpeg really works? I'll try a wrong path name and check.
//well, it turns out using /sdcard/a.mp4 works the same. so it's not working fine. but still, it's working anyway. better than didn't work at all.

#
as for SDL
how does the RenderCopy exactly works? how to output the video stream?

1. ffmpeg pre- functions did not works fine.
2. as for SDL, how does the RenderCopy exactly works? how to output the video stream?

yestoday I did nothing. shame. Played SANGO11 instread. It was fun though...

at date 3.30 I create a new project( FFmpegPlayer ) to test ffmpeg. It works fine. The sign of it working fine is that it recognize the format of a.mp4 and AVCodec->name = "H. 264".

So here comes the question: why ffmpeg with SDL failed?
In testff.c there're only ffmpeg. Works fine and got 'H 264' as well. The framework is ok. So maybe there's something with the SDL function call?

One important thing:
in project FFmpegPlayer, the file path is passed from Java to C indicating the target video file.
in project MediaPlayer, which is with SDL and ffmpeg, the file path currently is IN THE SOURCE CODE, "/mnt/sdcard/a.mp4", passing from SDL_android.main.cpp to main function in argv[1].

and one weird thing of FFmpegPlayer. compiled error on function "sws_getContext" and "sws_scale" but they can be compiled in MediaPlayer. didn't know why. ignored.

keep working.
white window and still frame decoded success. good.

ok i think i know why earlier I'll consider ffmpeg decoding wrong. Now in MediaPlayer I got ffmpeg and SDL working fine without any SDL code after a frame is decoded. Previously I have SDL code in it and the log only records the "packets". So I only got 3 "packets done" and program terminates. That means, SDL failed at presenting a frame, but ffmpeg works fine.
Hope I'm right.

It seems that it's the SDL_LockTexture function went wrong. Firstly I thought it was not usable. But then I double check it and I notice there's a parameter that is "void** pixels". I guess there's something to do with the void pointer.

just to be sure, now got 1 "frame decoded finished" and failed. the logcat was:
A 689 org.libsdl.app libc Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV) at 0x00000000 (code=1)

SDL_LockTexture is in jni/SDL/src/render/SDL_render.c, line 761
crazily I changed it and add logcat...

well, so it's the void pointer's problem......
